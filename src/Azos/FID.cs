  /* Timestamp: 24 bits
   * ------------------
   *
   *   100 msec interval = 10/sec
   *   10 * 60/sec * 60/min * 24/hr = 864,000 intervals/day
   *   2 ^ 24 = 16,777,216 combinations / 864,000 per day = 19.41 days ~> 2 weeks (almost 3, but we need 2 + reserved margin)
   *
   * ThreadSeed: 24 bits
   * -------------------
   *
   *   2^24 = 16,777,216 combinations
   *
   *   To create a duplicate ID within the same 100msec interval one would need to:
   *    a. allocate over 2^24 threads (this is not technically possible)
   *     or
   *    b. generate more than 2^24 * 2^16 IDs (1,099,511,627,776) from one thread (this is not technically possible)
   *     or
   *    c. allocate many threads and generate many IDs, thus wrapping around 2^24 in number of threads/blocks (this is not likely at all on any hardware)
   *
   *   If a process generates 1,000,000,000 IDs/sec (one billion IDs a second), then it generates 100,000,000 IDs/100 msec interval
   *     100,000,000 / 2^16 = 1,525 blocks (out of 2^24). Let's assume that there are 256 threads involved:
   *     100,000,000 / 256 threads = 390,625 IDs/thread  / 2^16 = 5.96 = 6 slots/thread * 256 threads = 1,536 blocks (out of 2^24)
   *
   * Counter: 16 bits
   * -----------------
   *
   *  2^16 = 65,536 combinations
   *
   *   When these are exhausted, a new thread seed block is generated and counter reset to 0

  /// <summary>
  /// Represents an ultra-efficient 64 bit in-process-wide unique identifier "Fast Id".
  /// The ID is going to wrap-around after at least 2 weeks (19 days).
  /// The ID consists of 3 segments: [timestamp: 24bit][threadseed: 24bit][counter: 16 bit].
  /// This is needed because:
  ///  a). FID stays unique after process restarts
  ///  b). This design does not use interlock on global seed, but uses thread-static vars which is 10-20 times faster
  ///
  /// The timestamp is the number of 100ms intervals elapsed since Jan 1 2015 expressed as a 24 bit unsigned int, which gives 2^24 = 16,777,216 combinations
  /// which covers 19 days (around 2 weeks) at 100 msec resolution, consequently the ID will generate duplicates after this period.
  /// This struct is useful for creating unique IDs for protocol/traffic messages that live for a limited time (no more than 2 weeks).
  /// Caution: This ID does not identify the machine or process, only items within the process, however when a hosting process restarts(i.e. crash or reboot)
  /// the new IDs will not collide with IDs generated right before the crash for at least 14 days (14 day sliding window).
  /// In a parallel test on 6 Core i7 3.2 GHz this class generates 405 million IDs/sec, which is 57 times faster than Guid that only generates 7 million IDs/sec
