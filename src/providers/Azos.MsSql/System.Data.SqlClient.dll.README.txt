THE PRESENCE OF INLINED DLL is a TEMP WORKAROUND!

MUST READ!!!!!!
----------------


Because of improper MsBuild dep resolution,
we have to inline sql client in here, otherwise the build out gets wrong version.

If you build .NET-only it puts the correct version in, however because THIS project is .NET Standard
there is dependency resolution bug in Nuget/MsBuild for consuming framework specific dll.
Why this happens with SqlClient -noone knows.


There is an issue with MsBuild/Nuget + SqlClient package: the build process does not put a proper System.Data.SqlClient.dll in the output of .NET framework target, the proper file is 233 kb, weheras a bad one is 255 kb. Will probably need to copy the DLL by hand
