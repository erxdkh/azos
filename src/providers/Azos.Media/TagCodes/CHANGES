 The Azos QR code generator is based on SOME PORTIONS of ZXing library hosted
 on https://github.com/zxing/zxing distributed with Apache 2.0 license

 Changes in Azos:

 Azos libary does not represent a direct port of zXing into C#, rather it only uses some base
  implementation/code patterns for QR code generation from zXing

 Refactorings of duplicate types/concepts that are already present in Azos, such as bit-oriented
 collections and error correction classes.

 Mended code identifier calling conventions per Azos standard (exception, method, variable, field, property names).

 Only the base idea of original zXing library was used in Azos.
